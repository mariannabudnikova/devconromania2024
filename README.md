# DevCon Romania 2024: Leveraging Business and Engineering Metrics with Ml-Powered Scorecards

This is a Jupyter notebook project. I run it in PyCharm, but you can also use VSCode. 

To launch the Jupyter notebook from PyCharm, you need to:
1) Create a Jupyter project in PyCharm
2) Open the product_health.ipynb file
3) Execute any code cell to launch the Jupyter server

To launch the Jupyter notebook from Visual Studio Code, follow the instructions [here]( https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/datascience/jupyter-notebooks).
